## I. Introduction to Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs are structured semantic knowledge bases used to quickly describe concepts in the physical world and their interrelationships. Through knowledge graphs, information, data, and link relationships on the Web can be aggregated into knowledge, making information resources more computable, understandable, and evaluable, and enabling rapid response and reasoning of knowledge.
### 1.1 Widely Applied in Various Fields

Currently, knowledge graphs have been widely applied in industrial fields, such as Google Search, Baidu Search in the search field, LinkedIn's Economic Graph in the social field, Tianyancha's Corporate Graph in the corporate information field, Taobao's Product Graph in the e-commerce field, Meituan's Knowledge Brain in the O2O field, DXY's Knowledge Graph in the medical field, and industrial manufacturing knowledge graphs, etc.

In the early stages of knowledge graph technology development, many enterprises and research institutions adopted a top-down approach to build basic knowledge bases, such as Freebase. With the continuous maturity of automatic knowledge extraction and processing technologies, current knowledge graphs are mostly constructed using a bottom-up approach, such as Google's Knowledge Vault and Microsoft's Satori knowledge base.

### 1.2 Classification of Construction Technologies

The construction technologies of knowledge graphs mainly include top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Top-down construction: Utilizing structured data sources such as encyclopedia websites to extract ontology and schema information from high-quality data and add it to the knowledge base.
Bottom-up construction: Utilizing certain technical means to extract resource patterns from publicly collected data, selecting information with higher confidence levels, and adding it to the knowledge base.

### 1.3 "Entity-Relationship-Entity" Triplets

The following diagram is a typical example of a knowledge graph. As can be seen, there are many nodes in the "graph". If there is a relationship between two nodes, they will be connected by an undirected edge. We call this node an entity (Entity), and the edge between nodes, we call a relationship (Relationship).

The basic unit of a knowledge graph is the "entity (Entity)-relationship (Relationship)-entity (Entity)" triplet, which is also the core of a knowledge graph.

## II. Data Types and Storage Methods

The original data types of knowledge graphs generally fall into three categories (also the three main types of data in the digital world): structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. Structured data refers to data that is organized in a fixed field within a record or file, such as data in relational databases. Semi-structured data does not reside in relational databases but has some organizational properties that make it easier to analyze, such as XML and JSON. Unstructured data is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner, such as texts, images, and videos.

### 2.1 Storage Methods

The storage methods of knowledge graphs mainly include the RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard and graph databases.

- **RDF Standard**: RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.

- **Graph Databases**: Graph databases are designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. They are intended to hold data without constricting it to a pre-defined model. Instead, the data is stored like nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), which allows for a flexible and efficient representation of real-world relationships.

### 2.2 Architecture

The architecture of a knowledge graph can be divided into two main parts: logical architecture and technical architecture.

- **Logical Architecture**: This includes the data layer, which stores the actual data, and the schema layer, which defines how the data is structured. The schema layer helps in understanding the data by providing a structured format.

- **Technical Architecture**: This involves the knowledge construction process, which includes information extraction, knowledge fusion, and knowledge processing. This process is crucial for transforming raw data into structured knowledge that can be easily understood and used by machines.

## III. Knowledge Graph Construction Technology

The construction of knowledge graphs involves several key technologies:

- **Information Extraction**: This is the process of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and semi-structured documents. Information extraction involves extracting entities, relationships, and attributes.

- **Knowledge Fusion**: This involves entity linking and knowledge merging. Entity linking is the process of linking entities extracted from text to entities in the knowledge graph. Knowledge merging involves integrating knowledge from different sources and resolving conflicts to create a consistent knowledge base.

- **Knowledge Processing**: This includes ontology extraction, knowledge reasoning, and quality assessment. Ontology extraction is the process of identifying the concepts and relationships that exist in a domain. Knowledge reasoning uses logical rules to infer new knowledge from the existing knowledge base. Quality assessment involves evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the knowledge graph.

### 3.1 Updates and Maintenance

Knowledge graphs require regular updates and maintenance to ensure their accuracy and relevance. There are two main methods for updating knowledge graphs:

- **Comprehensive Updates**: This involves periodically reprocessing the entire knowledge base to incorporate new information and correct errors. This method ensures the consistency and accuracy of the knowledge graph but can be resource-intensive.

- **Incremental Updates**: This method involves updating parts of the knowledge graph as new information becomes available. This is less resource-intensive than comprehensive updates but requires sophisticated mechanisms to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the knowledge graph.

## Conclusion

Knowledge graphs represent a significant advancement in the way we store, manage, and retrieve information. They enable a more intuitive and efficient way to understand complex relationships between data points. As technology continues to evolve, the use of knowledge graphs is expected to become more widespread, driving innovations across various fields.
