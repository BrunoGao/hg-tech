summary: |-
  Today, I recommend a **Developer Technology Learning Path** that provides a comprehensive technology roadmap suitable for developers of different levels.

  The project includes detailed learning path mind maps for front-end, back-end, full-stack, DevOps, Android, AI, big data, game development, and other directions.

  You can choose the corresponding mind map according to your direction and view the required technology stack. Click on the technology to view tutorials.

  In addition to role-based paths, the project also provides skill-based paths to guide you in learning specific programming languages or technologies.

  You can share or download the mind map to your local device and mark your learning status.

Today, I want to recommend a **Developer Technology Learning Path** to help us progress step by step in learning technology. It's suitable for both beginners and experienced developers!

## Project Introduction

`developer-roadmap` —— provides the most comprehensive developer technology roadmap. Currently, it has 259k+ Stars on GitHub, making it the project with the most stars I've ever seen!

It includes detailed learning path mind maps for front-end development, back-end development, full-stack development, DevOps, Android development, AI, big data, game development, and more.

![Role-based Path](https://heguang-tech-1300607181.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/46a660fdc9914a87b5dc2c97a82cfeaa~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp)

You can choose a directory according to your own direction to view the corresponding mind map, such as for back-end development.

![Back-end Development Technology Stack Path](https://heguang-tech-1300607181.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/658f622713414070bff4d51ed2781cf8~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp)

The mind map shows the technology stack needed for back-end development.

Networking, programming languages, Git, relational databases, NoSQL, APIs, caching, and more.

When you need to learn a certain technology, you can click to view the corresponding tutorial.

![MySQL Learning](https://heguang-tech-1300607181.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/74bab05d1dd94a38a7d0f1939784b3bf~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp)

If you want to specifically learn one or several programming languages, there are also guided paths. Java, C++, GO, Python, JavaScript, and other programming languages have detailed learning path mind maps.

Learning paths for middleware like Docker, MongoDB, SQL, Kubernetes are also available.

![Skill-based Path](https://heguang-tech-1300607181.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/e29a6b93e02f42b0b96463dfea8c7ce0~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp)

Similarly, choose a "skill" to view, such as the Java technology stack learning path.

For example, the SpringBoot technology stack learning path mind map:

We can share or download the mind map to our local device for real-time viewing!

![Share Mind Map](https://heguang-tech-1300607181.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/1868c06d5b8c4c7e9316df11990929f5~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp)

We can also plan our own technology learning path and then mark the learning (mastery) status, with three statuses: completed, in progress, and skipped.

![Mark Technology Status](https://heguang-tech-1300607181.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/aa8acbbdebc4499ebac544af25134fb7~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp)

## Conclusion

`developer-roadmap` —— truly serves as a roadmap for developers learning technology, covering various development directions, programming languages, technology learning, software architecture design. It can be described as comprehensive, multi-level, and three-dimensional technology learning path.
